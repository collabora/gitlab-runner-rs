#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! A crate to help build custom gitlab runner implementations.
//!
//! ## Implementing a custom runner
//!
//! The overall idea is that this crate handles all interaction with the gitlab
//! server and drives the executions while the the runner implementation focus on
//! how to handle jobs from gitlab.
//!
//! As the focus for an implementer of a custom runner is to implement the async
//! JobHandler trait, which gets calle during job executation. An absolute minimal
//! runner can be implement as such:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use gitlab_runner::{outputln, Runner, JobHandler, JobResult, Phase};
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct Run {}
//!
//! #[async_trait::async_trait]
//! impl JobHandler for Run {
//!       async fn step(&mut self, script: &[String], phase: Phase) -> JobResult {
//!           outputln!("Running script for phase {:?}", phase);
//!           for s in script {
//!             outputln!("Step: {}", s);
//!           }
//!           Ok(())
//!       }
//! }
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     let mut runner = Runner::new(
//!         "https://gitlab.example.com".try_into().unwrap(),
//!         "runner token".to_owned(),
//!         PathBuf::from("/tmp"));
//!     runner.run(move | _job | async move { Ok(Run{})  }, 16).await.unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Gitlab runner registration
//!
//! This crate does not support registering new runners with the gitlab server, so this has to be
//! done by hand using the gitlab
//! [runner registration API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner).
//!
//! The registration token can be retrieved from the runners section in the Gitlab
//! administration area. With that token the runner can be register using a curl
//! command like:
//! ```shell
//! curl --request POST "https://GITLAB_URL/api/v4/runners"  \
//!   --form "description=My custom runner" \
//!   --form "run_untagged=false" \
//!   --form "tag_list=custom-gitlab-runner" \
//!   --form "token=REGISTRATION_TOKEN"
//! ```
//!
//! As a response to this command a new token for the registered runner will be
//! provided, this token should be provided to the runner for it's gitlab
//! connection.
//!
//! One thing to key parameter provided here is `run_untagged=false`, which will
//! make the runner *only* pickup jobs which matches its tag. This is important to
//! prevent the runner from picking up "normal" jobs which it will not be able to
//! process.
